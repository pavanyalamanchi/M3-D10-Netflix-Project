# M3-D10-Netflix-Project

Netflix Home Page Clone, with a backoffice functionality to add data dynamically through API



API takes data from backoffice and homepage retrieves data from API which we posted through backoffice.

FEATURES:

/ Creating a backoffice page for inserting, editing and removing movies

/ Every movie will have a category

/ On the main page you should create, programmatically, a number of “lists” equal to the number of categories you have created
